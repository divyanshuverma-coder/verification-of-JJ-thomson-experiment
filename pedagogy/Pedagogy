#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce Theoritical Concepts and experimentation
The student understands that velocity of electron depends on applied electric and magnetic force. By applying Maxwell's equation a force works on an electron which causes deflection of electron beam. By calculating its displacement from zero deflection point, we calculate charge to mass ratio which remains constant at variable values of E and B.

#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>
<div>
    The quizes are provided that will judge and inhance the skills of the Student.
    Each question is relevent to the experiment and just ment to increase the understanding of experiment and their concept.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for value of electric and magnetic field | Charge to mass ratio will be displayed. 
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student.
