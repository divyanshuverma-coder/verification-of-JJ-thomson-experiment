## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1:Verification of mass ratio by using JJ Thomson's experiment.

### 1. Story Outline:

When it was believed that atoms are fundamental building blocks of material then this experiment proved it to be wrong.
Thomson’s this experiment which cathode ray tube show that atoms contains negatively charged particles named as electron and when he used Maxwell theory an tried to explore it more, he get to know that there was an specific characteristics observed that charge to mass ratio remain constant when we change the external magnetic field.

### 2. Story:

1. Enter the value of E and B.<br>
2. To determine “v”.<br>
3.Press the click button to proceed.<br>
4.Observe the e/m ratio.<br>
5.Reverse it again with different value of E and B.

<br>


When the sample is introduced between the charge plates, current flows and the atom get broken down into charges, in the form of cathode rays. <br>From maxwell's theory, we know that charged particles could be diflected in a magnetic field<br> F<sub>e</sub> = e*E<br>F<sub>b</sub> = -evB<br>In the inital condition when no deflection observed, total force on the elctron will be zero<br><br><center>F<sub>e</sub>+F<sub>b</sub>=0<br>e*E - e*v*B = 0<br>v=E/B</center><br><br>There is only electric field in the y-direction that is F<sub>e</sub>=e*E and no force in x-direction. Since in y-direction<center>y=1/2*a*t<sup>2</sup><br>a=F/m=E*e/m<br></center>So,<center>y=1/2*e*E*t<sup>2</sup>/m</center><br>Since, we know that    x=vt<br><center>e/m=2*y*E/x<sup>2</sup>*B<sub>2</sub></center>Using the experimental apparatus, thomson was able to determine charge to mass ratio which is 1.75*10<sup>11</sup>C/Kg.


### 3. User objective goals<br>
